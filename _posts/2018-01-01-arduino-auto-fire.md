2018 Arduino button masher device
  Played a game that required you to mash a button. i got tired of it and bought a device that could act like a keyboard and mash a key instead of damaging my wrist.
  recorded real world timings between key press to give a realistic input if there is anything trying to detect inhuman reaction timings.
