2020 Refine DIY battery design,

  saw issues with design like corrosion from areas where contact was not perfect causing sparks.

  redesigned to be more solid and added more batteries because I had them.

  Extra weight caused the aluminum welds in my bike rack to break.

  Purchased alternative bike rack designed to accept 100lb

  Found design flaw where the bike rack was solid for downward force but a soft metal was used to take forward and backward forces. In the scenario of an ebike it is high torque on tha start and stops so my 3rd ride the support mount snapped.

  Installed 3 replacement mountings to make sure that crap never happens again.
