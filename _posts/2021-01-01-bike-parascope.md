2021 use fresnel lenses to let you see in front of you while looking down on a road bike.
  Goal make alternative to https://www.amazon.com/VeloView-Triathlete-Avoiding-Shermers-Syndrome/dp/B07831D2PS
  Strategy use things like fresnel lense, concave lense, prism, etc to DIY this cheaper and better.
  Went with a good initial attempt but put on hold till capable of measuring and adjusting lense placement better.
