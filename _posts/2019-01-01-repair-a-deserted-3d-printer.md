2019 acquired & repaired printer:

  test & notice existing issues. (basically started playing with it and ran into errors with temperature stability)

  order replacement parts. nozzle upgrades and new temp sensor.

  install and modify firmware to tune temp sensor values to be close to what was measured in real world use.
