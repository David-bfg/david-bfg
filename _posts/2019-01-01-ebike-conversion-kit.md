2019 EBike conversion kit DIY-ing my own battery for it,

  Learned through youtube videos till I knew enough to be dangerous. âš¡!

  assessed the available space where my bike rack could hold a battery

  decide on cell size based on price 18650 vs 21700 (newer high capacity lithium cells used in tesla cars) price per watt appeared to be similar but slightly better for the 21700 when buying new. Goal was to have a 10+ years lifespan for the battery so purchasing replacement cells in the future would probably be cheaper or find old tesla batteries to reuse.

  designed shape to fill bottom area of bike rack

  decide on size/cell arrangement. different configurations affect the output voltage and max amperage. Bought a 10amp 42v charger. that converts to what would be a 420w power supply.

  It definitely looked unique. Many people didn't quite know what to make of it. The front tire was a hub motor (small) so it didn't exactly scream EBike. The most common guess was that it was to keep the food in my bag warm. (Maybe they just didn't want to say bomb in public.)
