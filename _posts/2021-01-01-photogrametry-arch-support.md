2021 Photogrametry arch support
  had some foot pain have high arches
  used photogrametry to turn a series of pictures to a 3d model of my foot and it's arch
  smoothed out surface in blender with other touch ups
  3d printed arch supports
  long term, the PLA plastic eventually crumbled under the weight of a person. I found a reasonably priced arch support at a local department store. Yet that 3d print did fit like a glove.
