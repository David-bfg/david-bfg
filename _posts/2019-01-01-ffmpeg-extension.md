2019 made extension to ffmpeg
  Have been interested in Virtual Machines and used tool called looking glass
  Implemented Extension to use looking glass to desktop record the VM on the host machine using ffmpeg option
  Asked forum if there was much interest. Didn't get much response so I decided against doing the extra work to submit it to the main project.
