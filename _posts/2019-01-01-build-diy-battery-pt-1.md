  3d printed parts for my ebike battery.

  accuracy tests showed I could print 0.2 mm between parts for Items to not fuse together.

  I made battery legos where there was .075 mm shaved off of the sides giving .15mm of clearance connecting parts together.

  They fit perfectly in the sense that I had to hammer them together and I could tell that each ripple from a given layer was interlocking

  Diagram.
```
               ----- < (    layer ripple part 2
layer ripple part 1   ) > -----
               ----- < (    layer ripple part 2
layer ripple part 1   ) > -----
               ----- < (    layer ripple part 2
layer ripple part 1   ) > -----
```
  each lego like piece had slit going through the center for connecting each battery electrically
