2022 Unique game strategy to cheese game mechanic
  I found myself watching someone play a classic game and felt nostalgic.
  I owned the game so figured I'd play along but found myself playing through the entire game till the next week the person played.
  Started researching strategies and looked for ways to play smart (to enjoy and learn game mechanics) instead of grinding levels to get your character overpowered.
  Made a youtube guide at https://www.youtube.com/@overpoweredfinalshipposter3438
  The person I was watching got to a hard part and I messaged him offering a save file with matching character names. Said just say you were grinding and if they wonder why you have a special item just say it was a lucky drop.
