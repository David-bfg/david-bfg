<h1>Hello my name is David.</h1>

I've started this blog to have a portfolio for various different projects I've worked on. I started each of them for one reason or another; be it fixing a problem in a neat way or focussing on an issue, thinking through whats needed and executing a plan of action to get the solution I want. Overall a resume is fairly boring and disengaging topic to spend 15 minutes in an interview talking to someone about. I'd rather spend that time chatting about a random side project of mine they thought was interesting.

Go, look through this blog. There are a variety of subjects that range from technical-software projects to creating some useful things-tools with easily comprehensible solutions to some everyday annoyances. Find a project that interests you and learn a little bit about my thought process. Hopefuly this is the first step for us to have a good and sucessful interview. I'd be happy to talk your ear off about any of the projects I've started.
